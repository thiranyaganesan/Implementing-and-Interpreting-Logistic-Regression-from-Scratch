# Analysis of Actual Learned Weights

The model was trained on a synthetic dataset with 5 informative features.
Below are the *actual* learned weights from the final logistic regression training:

- **Feature 1: weight = 0.3530**
- **Feature 2: weight = -0.2948**
- **Feature 3: weight = 0.6422**
- **Feature 4: weight = -1.6559**
- **Feature 5: weight = -1.3297**

## Interpretation
- Feature 1 has a **moderate increases** effect on predicting class 1.
- Feature 2 has a **weak decreases** effect on predicting class 1.
- Feature 3 has a **moderate increases** effect on predicting class 1.
- Feature 4 has a **strong decreases** effect on predicting class 1.
- Feature 5 has a **strong decreases** effect on predicting class 1.

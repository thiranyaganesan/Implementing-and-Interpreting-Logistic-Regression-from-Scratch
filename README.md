# Implementing-and-Interpreting-Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch
This project involves implementing logistic regression from scratch using NumPy—building the sigmoid function, binary cross-entropy loss, and gradient descent. You then test the model on synthetic data and interpret learned coefficients to understand feature importance in a binary classification scenario.
